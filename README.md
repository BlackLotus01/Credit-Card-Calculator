I only started to learn programming a few weeks ago. I created an Excel spreadsheet and thought why 
not make a program mimicking the spreadsheet. I want to eventually take three credit cards, compute 
the expected values, and compute the expected value to determine which credit card provides the best long term value. 

# Credit-Card-Calculator
# The calculator will take three credit cards and evaluate the best option for an credit card applicant.
